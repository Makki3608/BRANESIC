# BRANESIC

## What ?

A compiler and higher-level programming language, compiling to '[Branefuck](https://github.com/skirlez/void-stranger-endless-void/wiki/Branefuck)', a modified version of '[Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)' for the level editor mod '[Endless Void](https://github.com/skirlez/void-stranger-endless-void)', for the game '[Void Stranger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_Stranger)'. Aren't hyperlinks fun ?

## Why ?

Because making a programming language is a programming rite of passage. Or so i've been told. And writing a C compiler is boring and too hard. Anyways, maybe this could be useful to anyone making [Endless Void](https://github.com/skirlez/void-stranger-endless-void) levels.

## How do I use it ?

~~### You can either:~~

~~Download the executable. Run it. ( Not recommended cus you can't modify Config or The Dictionaries. I know that's stupid. Working on that )~~
Okay I can't pyinstall to work I swear it worked before I need 2 go to bed.

### Or you can:

`git clone https://github.com/Makki3608/Branesic-Compiler.git`
and run __main__.py
